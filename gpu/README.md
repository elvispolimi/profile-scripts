# GPU Profiling Scripts

Scope: vendor-specific scripts that run command-line profilers, collect metrics, and
produce roofline or histogram artifacts for selected kernels.

This repository is organized by vendor:

- `gpu/nvidia/` contains NVIDIA-specific profiling scripts and tooling.
- `gpu/amd/` contains AMD-specific profiling scripts and tooling.
- `gpu/intel/` contains Intel-specific profiling scripts and tooling.

See each vendor README for usage details.
